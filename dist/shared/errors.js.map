If the resource couldn't be found because the input was invalid use\n * {@link InvalidInput} instead.\n *\n * @property {ErrorKind} InvalidInput There was a problem with provided input,\n * such as the wrong format. This indicates inputs that are problematic\n * regardless of the state of the system. If the input was valid but caused\n * problems anyway consider {@link NotAllowed}.\n *\n * @property {ErrorKind} NotAllowed There was a problem due to the state of the\n * system not matching the requested operation or input. For example, trying to\n * create a username that is valid, but is already taken by another user. Use\n * {@link InvalidInput} instead when the input isn't valid regardless of\n * the state of the system. Use {@link NotFound} when the failure is due\n * to not being able to find a resource.\n *\n * @property {ErrorKind} Unauthorized There was an access control problem\n *\n * @property {ErrorKind} Internal The function failed for a reason unrelated\n * to invalid input or problems working with a remote system.
