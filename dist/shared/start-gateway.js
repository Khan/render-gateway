   * NOTE(somewhatabstract): We have seen many 502 BAD GATEWAY errors in
   * production Node services. It seems this is because the Node server
   * is closing a connection before the load balancer is expecting it to.
   * There is some indication on the Internet [1] that the issue can occur
   * when Node's (or nginx [2]) keepalive is lower than the load balancer's
   * keepalive. In addition, the recommended fix is to always have the load
   * balancer close a connection by ensuring the Node server has a higher
   * keepalive timeout value than the load balancer.
   *
   * Node's default is 5s, but the indication is that the Google load
   * balancer value is 80s [3]. So, here we default to 90s, but we also
   * provide a configuration value to change it as needed.
   *
   * In addition, it is suggested that the headers timeout should be higher
   * than the keepalive timeout [1].
